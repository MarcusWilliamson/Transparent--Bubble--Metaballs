    <a href="src/main.js">Main.js</a><br>
    <p><b>User Guide: </b>Use the left and right mouse buttons to move and rotate the camera, and the scroll wheel to zoom. To view the scene in VR,<br>
        click the "Enter VR" button at the bottom of the screen.</p>

    <p><b>Description: </b>This program uses metaballs/marching cubes with a transparent material to simulate bubbles. I based my metaball implementation<br>
        on the three.js docs example at: https://threejs.org/examples/webgl_marchingcubes.html, which uses three.js's built-in marching cubes<br>
        module. I used WebXR to enable the scene to be viewed in VR. Camera movement was implemented using three.js's OrbitControls.<br>
        Upon pressing "Enter VR," the user's XR Transform (which controls the camera in VR) position will be set to the camera position set by<br>
        the user. The material I used is a PhysicalMaterial with its transmission set to 1.0, which creates the transparent effect. The scene also<br>
        applies environment mapping to the material based on the background texture, which is a 360 degree HDRi. This environment mapping generates<br>
        a lighting effect on the bubbles without using light sources in the scene. The program should run on a desktop or laptop computer fine.<br>
        Have not yet tested with standalone/mobile VR.
